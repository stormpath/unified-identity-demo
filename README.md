## Purpose

This demo app showcases how you can easily throw together a web application with
user registration, authentication, and social login using plain old Javascript.

This application works by using [Stormpath][] to store your user accounts and
user data, using [OAuth.io][] to handle social login and account linking, and
using [Heroku][] to easily host the web application for free.

The guide below explains how to make this example application run in your own
environment.


## What it Looks Like
